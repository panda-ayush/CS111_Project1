# CS111_Project1
A simple drawing

What you will demonstrate
Ability to break a problem down into smaller problems
Ability to represent solutions as combinations of blocks, conditionals, loops and functions
Ability to write Python code to implement your solutions
Ability to use good programming style
What you will produce
For this project, you will use Turtles to create a scene by combining shapes.  The scene will have some background element(s) and some recognizable object(s) in the foreground.  

You'll design a scene and then "solve the problem" of how to draw it with at least two Turtles. You will then write a main function in Python (named main) to call on those other functions to draw the background and your shapes.
Your scene must include text indicating the name of your scene.
Your repl.it should include your initial paper drawing of your scene.  (One option:  draw it out on paper, take a picture of it, bluetooth to computer or email it to yourself, upload the image to your repl.it)
